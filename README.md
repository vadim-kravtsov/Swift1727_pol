Figure 1: Normalized Stokes parameters of the observed polarization of new BH candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 in B, V, and R (from left to right).
Color coding corresponds to JD from 2460189 (yellow) to 2460202 (dark blue). Light blue circle shows average polarization of two field stars with distances 
in range of 1.5 to 3 kpc, which we use as an interstellar polarization estimate.

Figure 2: Variations of the intrinsic (after subtracting the interstellar contribution) PD and PA of optical polarization of Swift J1727.8-1613 in B, V, and R bands (from top to bottom). The errors are 1 sigma.
