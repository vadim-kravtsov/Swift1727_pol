# Swift1727_pol

Normalized Stokes parameters of the observed polarization of new BH candidate Swift JJ1727.8-1613 in B, V, and R (from left to right).
Color coding corresponds to JD from 2460189 (yellow) to 2460202 (dark blue). Light blue circle shows average polarization of two field stars with parallaxes 
in range of 1.5 to 3 kpc, which we use as an interstellar polarization estimate.
